# Simple Recommend System
A simple recommend system write by React&amp;Flask


The project has implemented a toy recommend system, the system can perform online&offline recommendation and is designed with the ability to collect users behaviour statistics for further usage. 

The detail is shown in detail.pdf.

FYI, the CF recommendation there is using trained model of BiasSVD written in there "Link", and in this repo I also implement other classic algorithoms like deepFM,DCN,Wide&Depp ,etc.Execpt xDeepFM, these algs are all implemented by numpy.
